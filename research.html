          <p class="paragraph pt-2">
            Genetics has a role in every discipline of medicine. Traditionally
            it is known that genetic disorders are untreatable hence hesitation
            to invest on genetic disease. Now this concept is changing. The
            major contribution of genetics is to predict and prevent a disorder
            thus decreasing its burden right from the planning of reproduction.
            To fulfil this objective a new branch, known as Reproductive
            Genetics, has immerged. Reproductive genetics is a branch of science
            that deals with the genetic contribution of reproductive process,
            both natural and assisted. Now it expands to include studying
            genetic as well as epigenetic modifications of genome and its effect
            on reproduction. Genetic factors are greatly responsible for
            infertility, abortion, stillbirth, malformation and cancer.
            Reproductive genetics is becoming an integral part of today’s

            Genetics has a role in every discipline of medicine. Traditionally
            it is known that genetic disorders are untreatable hence hesitation

            on reproduction. Genetic factors are greatly responsible for
            infertility, abortion, stillbirth, malformation and cancer.
            Reproductive genetics is becoming an integral part of today’s
            reproductive practice due to increase in the burden of reproductive
            disorders. The ideal time to apply reproductive genetics should be
            from the time of pre-conception or peri-conception period so that
            prediction and/or prevention (primary and/or secondary) is possible.
            Advances in molecular and reproductive technology (next generation
            sequencing and microarray), introduction of non-invasive prenatal
            screening/testing (NIPS/NIPT), preimplantation genetic
            screening/diagnosis (PGD/PGS), rapid prenatal diagnosis, fetal
            imaging (fetal ultrasonography/fetal MRI), etc. has increased this
            drive and expectations of public. The NIPT/NIPS is an upcoming
            technology for screening fetal aneuploidies (in particular trisomy
            21) from cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) present in blood of pregnant
            woman. The low false positive rate is the most important advantage
            of NIPT as it allows women to avoid unnecessary invasive procedures
            such as amniocentesis or chorionic villous sampling (trisomy 21
            pick-up rate as high as 1 in 2; far better than 1 in 250 with serum
            screening like triple/dual marker tests). The NIPT/NIPS can also
            determine paternity, fetal sex, fetal rhesus D (RhD) status, copy
            number variations (microdeletion/microduplication syndromes) or even
            single gene disorders but not yet recommended by professional
            bodies. The advent of preimplantation and prenatal diagnosis has
            allowed option of having unaffected offspring in couples at risk of
            transmitting genetic disorder. Preimplantation genetic screening
            using DNA microarray/NGS improves the effectiveness of in vitro
            fertilization by selecting normal embryo for implantation. This has
            immensely increased the scope of genetic testing in reproductive
            practice. Moreover, progress has been made in universal screening to
            detect abnormal fetuses. This has further extended the need for
            reproductive genetics. Furthermore, rapid dissemination of
            information to public and health care provider has affected daily
            reproductive care so much that an understanding of genetics is
            essential for all reproductive specialist in particular to know risk
            of a genetic disorder and how to prevent. This knowledge will
            protect reproductive specialist from medico-legal consequences
            following failing in preventing genetic disorders in a family.
            Reproductive disorders requiring expert management from a
            reproductive genetics specialist are unexplained repeated pregnancy
            loss (e.g., abortion, intrauterine deaths, hydrops, hydramnios,
            preeclampsia, growth retardation, hydatidiform mole, etc.), fetal
            malformation (particularly recurrent), unexplained infertility,
            recurrent failure of assisted reproduction, premature ovarian
            failure, polycystic ovarian syndrome, unexplained primary
            amenorrhoea, endometriosis, azoospermia/ oligospermia, disorder of
            sex development, advanced parental age, abnormal maternal serum
            screening test, abnormal obstetric ultrasound evaluation, previous
            fetus/child with genetic disorder or chromosomal disorder or
            malformations, parent with genetic disorder, family history of
            genetic disorder, maternal disorders associated with an increased
            risk for fetal congenital defect (e.g., maternal diabetes, epilepsy
            on epileptics, etc.), maternal exposure to teratogen (drugs,
            infections, radiation, toxins, etc.) in peri-conception period,
            consanguinity, before and after offering prenatal/preimplantation
            screening or prenatal/preimplantation diagnosis, familial
            reproductive cancer, risk to reproduction from cancer
            chemotherapy/radiotherapy and risk to offspring from cancer
            chemotherapy/radiotherapy, etc. [1].
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            The infertility is another major area in reproductive genetics.
            Genetics (mostly of sex chromosomes) account for 15–30% of male and
            10-15% of female infertility as of now but this are going to change
            in the near future as many newer genetic/genomic/epigenomic factors
            are coming [1]. The genetic basis of infertility may result from
            chromosomal abnormalities, Yq microdeletion, CNVs (particularly sex
            chromosomes), monogenic, multifactorial, epigenomic, mitochondrial,
            etc. We have observed CNVs in pseudo autosomal regions 1 and 2 (PAR
            1 and 2) as well as gain (3 copies) in AZF loci besides global/
            specific (e.g., GSTT1 gene) hypomethylation in testicular maturation
            arrest [2]. The other well-known genetic defects/ mutations
            associated with male infertility are CFTR (vassal agenesis)/CATSPER1
            (asthenozoospermia)/SPATA16 and DPY19L2 (globozoospermia)/ AURKC
            (macro spermatozoa) and with female infertility are FMR1/
            FOXL2/BMP15 genes. Genetics is becoming more important following the
            development of in vitro fertilization and intra cytoplasmic sperm
            injection as these procedures lead to more genetic abnormality in
            offspring, since it passess through in vitro system as well as
            bypasses physiological protective mechanisms. Available data so far
            have shown that there is an increased risk of chromosomal
            abnormality, in particular sex chromosome, congenital malformations
            and imprinting defects in babies conceived by ART/ICSI besides
            epigenetic effects (including birth weight) related to in vitro
            culture, cryopreservation, handling stress, etc.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            An understanding of reproductive genetics of major developmental
            disorders is also important for today’s perinatal care specialists
            [3]. Detailed assessment of malformed fetus after termination of
            pregnancy (spontaneous/induced) is important for precise diagnosis.
            The challenges are to understand pathophysiology of lethal
            developmental defects and to resolute phenotype and genotype
            heterogeneity. It is hoped that the information generated on this
            field in coming years and later integrated in system biology will be
            of great service to answer questions that are encountered every day
            in teratology/dysmorphology practice viz., genetic/genomic role,
            underlying pathophysiology, early prediction or prevention and
            feasibility of pharmacotherapy.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Advances in reproductive technology like cellular reprogramming or
            cellular differentiation/ dedifferentiation, etc. has created
            another dimension for reproductive genetics. Now, in the laboratory
            stem cell can be manipulated to become specialized cells and can be
            used to treat disease. Embryonic stem cells can be differentiated
            into gamete (sperm/oocytes) to treat infertility or into trophoblast
            for studying human placental development and function. Therefore,
            development of novel method for precisely controlled differentiation
            is crucial to facilitate the application in clinical practice or
            research. Recent progress in germline stem cell isolation and
            culture may provide a platform for in vitro gamete development and
            may open a new era of gametogenesis in a dish and personalized
            infertility treatment in coming years. For therapy with stem cells,
            the issue of immunocompatibility arises. The breakthroughs in
            somatic cell nuclear transfer have raised the possibility of
            generating unlimited sources of undifferentiated cells, with
            potential applications (therapeutic/reproductive cloning) without
            immune rejection.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Another area of reproductive genetics is reproductive cancers which
            needs special attention as reproductive cancers are increasing,
            appearing in very younger age (in particular ovarian; 35% cases
            below 25 years), poor prognosis due to late diagnosis (ovarian
            epithelial cancer), following exposure (estrogen) in fetal life
            (testicular dysgenesis syndrome, adenocarcinoma uterus/vagina, etc.)
            and often familial (breast, ovary, endometrium). Germ line mutations
            are responsible for familial cancer viz., BRCA mutation in familial
            breast and ovarian cancer. In the current era of genome sequencing,
            clinical cancer diagnosis is undergoing a transformation [4]. This
            technology has enabled the discovery of genes implicated in cancer
            risk and creating opportunities for the development of more precise
            and early tumor detection, even at preimplantation/prenatal stage.
            The growing possibility of cancer prediction, prevention and early
            precision treatment seems reality.

          <p class="paragraph">
            Once genomic screening technologies are used as part of predictive
            medicine practice, high-risk groups may be identified before
            development of disease and appropriate measures may be started
            before the pathology is too late in near future. Cases like
            klinefelter syndrome, turner syndrome, Yq microdeletion, premature
            ovarian failure, etc where pathology manifests after puberty may
            benefit in future through predictive genomic medicine practice
            (prediction before disease manifestation followed by preventive
            measures like gonad/gamete cryopreservation and later when required
            in vitro/in vivo gametogenesis).
