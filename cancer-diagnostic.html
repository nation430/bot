            How Cancer Is Diagnosed
          </h3>
          <p class="paragraph pt-2">
            If you have a symptom or a screening test result that suggests
            cancer, your doctor must find out whether it is due to cancer or
            some other cause. The doctor may start by asking about your personal
            and family medical history and do a physical exam. The doctor also
            may order lab tests, imaging tests (scans), or other tests or
            procedures. You may also need a biopsy, which is often the only way
            to tell for sure if you have cancer. This page covers tests that are
            often used to help diagnose cancer. Depending on the symptoms you
            have, you may have other tests, too. To learn more about how
            specific cancers are diagnosed, see the

            Imaging Tests
          </h3>
          <p class="paragraph pt-2">
            Imaging tests create pictures of areas inside your body that help
            the doctor see whether a tumor is present. These pictures can be
            made in several ways:
          </p>
          <h3 class="">
            CT Scan
          </h3>
          <p class="paragraph pt-2">
            A CT scan uses an x-ray machine linked to a computer to take a
            series of pictures of your organs from different angles. These
            pictures are used to create detailed 3-D images of the inside of
            your body.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Sometimes, you may receive a dye or other contrast material before
            you have the scan. You might swallow the dye, or it may be given by
            a needle into a vein. Contrast material helps make the pictures
            easier to read by highlighting certain areas in the body.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            During the CT scan, you will lie still on a table that slides into a
            donut-shaped scanner. The CT machine moves around you, taking
            pictures. Learn more about CT scans and how they are used to
            diagnose cancer.

          <h3 class="">
            MRI
          </h3>
          <p class="paragraph pt-2">
            An MRI uses a powerful magnet and radio waves to take pictures of
            your body in slices. These slices are used to create detailed images
            of the inside of your body, which can show the difference between
            healthy and unhealthy tissue.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            When you have an MRI, you lie still on a table that is pushed into a
            long, round chamber. The MRI machine makes loud thumping noises and
            rhythmic beats.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Sometimes, you might have a special dye injected into your vein
            before or during your MRI exam. This dye, called a contrast agent,
            can make tumors show up brighter in the pictures.
          </p>
          <h3 class="">
            Nuclear scan
          </h3>
          <p class="paragraph pt-2">
            A nuclear scan uses radioactive material to take pictures of the
            inside of the body. This type of scan may also be called
            radionuclide scan.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Before this scan, you receive an injection of a small amount of
            radioactive material, which is sometimes called a tracer. It flows
            through your bloodstream and collects in certain bones or organs.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            During the scan, you lie still on a table while a machine called a
            scanner detects and measures the radioactivity in your body,
            creating pictures of bones or organs on a computer screen or on
            film.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            After the scan, the radioactive material in your body will lose its
            radioactivity over time. It may also leave your body through your
            urine or stool.
          </p>
          <h3 class="">
            Bone Scan
          </h3>
          <p class="paragraph pt-2">
            Bone scans are a type of nuclear scan that check for abnormal areas
            or damage in the bones. They may be used to diagnose bone cancer or
            cancer that has spread to the bones (also called metastatic bone
            tumors).
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Before this test, a very small amount of radioactive material is
            injected into your vein. As it travels through the blood, the
            material collects in abnormal areas in the bone. Areas where the
            material collects show up on pictures taken by a special scanner.
            These areas are called “hot spots.”

            PET scan
          </h3>
          <p class="paragraph pt-2">
            A PET scan is a type of nuclear scan that makes detailed 3-D
            pictures of areas inside your body where glucose is taken up.
            Because cancer cells often take up more glucose than healthy cells,
            the pictures can be used to find cancer in the body.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            Before the scan, you receive an injection of a tracer called
            radioactive glucose. During the scan, you will lie still on a table
            that moves back and forth through a scanner.
          </p>

            Ultrasound
          </h3>
          <p class="paragraph pt-2">
            An ultrasound exam uses high-energy sound waves that people cannot
            hear. The sound waves echo off tissues inside your body. A computer
            uses these echoes to create pictures of areas inside your body. This
            picture is called a sonogram.
          </p>
          <p class="paragraph">
            During an ultrasound exam, you will lie on a table while a tech
            slowly moves a device called a transducer on the skin over the part
            of the body that is being examined. The transducer is covered with a
            warm gel that makes it easier to glide over the skin.

            X-rays
          </h3>
          <p class="paragraph pt-2">
            X-rays use low doses of radiation to create pictures inside your
            body. An x-ray tech will put you in position and direct the x-ray
            beam to the correct part of your body. While the images are taken,
            you will need to stay very still and may need to hold your breath
            for a second or two.

          </h3>
          <p class="paragraph pt-2">
            In most cases, doctors need to do a biopsy to diagnose cancer. A
            biopsy is a procedure in which the doctor removes a sample of
            tissue. A pathologist looks at the tissue under a microscope and
            runs other tests to see if the tissue is cancer. The pathologist
            describes the findings in a pathology report, which contains details
            about your diagnosis. Pathology reports play an important role in
            diagnosing cancer and helping decide treatment options. Learn more

          <p class="paragraph">
            <span class="bold">With endoscopy: </span>The doctor uses a thin,
            lighted tube called an endoscope to examine areas inside the body.
            Endoscopes go into natural body openings, such as the mouth or anus.
            If the doctor sees abnormal tissue during the exam, he will remove
            the abnormal tissue along with some of the surrounding normal tissue
            through the endoscope.

              colon and rectum. In this type of exam, an endoscope goes through
              the anus, allowing the doctor to examine the rectum and colon. If
              the doctor sees polyps, she will remove them and send them to a
              lab for testing.

            If the biopsy and other tests show that you have cancer, you may
            have more tests to help your doctor plan treatment. For instance,
            your doctor will need to figure out the stage of your cancer. For
            some cancers, knowing the grade of the tumor or risk group that you

            tumor may also be tested further for other tumor or genetic markers.
